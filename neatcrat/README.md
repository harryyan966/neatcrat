to use in jupyter notebook, run this:

```python
from neatcrat import * # imports custom datatypes and np, pd, plt
plt.rcParams["animation.html"] = "jshtml" # enable video features
plt.rcParams['figure.dpi'] = 100 # set it to anything you want
plt.ioff() # prevents double figure
```

agent, classifier, constants, data, scene, trajectory, utils may be used for final result

debug and plot are for visualization
